                        Users, including both Clients and Freelancers, must provide accurate and truthful information during registration. While anonymity is maintained, sharing personal contact details such as phone numbers, emails, or social media handles is strictly prohibited. Any violation of this rule may result in account suspension or permanent ban from the platform.

                        Clients can hire freelancers based on their skills, ratings, and past work. Freelancers are expected to complete tasks within the agreed deadlines. Clients have the option to request revisions before approving the final submission. The admin panel actively manages disputes to ensure fair and transparent resolutions.

                        Clients deposit payments into an escrow system, which are released to freelancers upon task approval. Once a task is approved by the client, refunds will not be issued. In case of disputes, our admin team will review the case and make a final, binding decision.
